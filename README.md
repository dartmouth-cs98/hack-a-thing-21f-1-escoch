# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

Having used a number of linux tools, and CLI app generators, I was interested in learning more broadly about how CLIs work and how they're built. I wanted to experiment with builing one and dive into all the possibilities CLI tools have to offer. I think they're a great set of tools to boost development productivity, explore data, and have fun on the terminal.

## Who Did What?
I worked on my own but built on top of the `corona-cli`
## What you learned
* Argument Parsing
* Updated npm modules to ES6 environment
* Experimented with differnt npm packages like loadash for sorting, meow for args
comma-number for nicely formatted numbers
*  Also played around with blessed for charts quite a bit and boxen for tables on the Command Line
